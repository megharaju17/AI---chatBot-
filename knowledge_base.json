India has accused Pakistan-based militants of orchestrating the attack, while Pakistan denies involvement and calls for an impartial investigation. In retaliation, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, expelled Pakistani diplomats, and closed major border crossings. Pakistan responded by suspending visas for Indian nationals, closing its airspace to Indian flights, and expelling Indian diplomats. China has urged both nations to exercise restraint amid the escalating tensions. \u200b"
